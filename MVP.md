## Analysis of the MTA Turnstiles:

#### My project focus on where to put vending machines that sells drinks, foods and electronics in stations that have most traffic in the summer.

#### In the beginning of this project, I tried to find the top stations that have most entrants and I used seaborn graph after I did some cleaning and I found these are the top ten stations in the summer.
**As you can see this graph represent number of entrants in y-axis and station names in the x-axis.
Next steps:**
-	Find top entry for every station.
-	Find daily traffic per day.
